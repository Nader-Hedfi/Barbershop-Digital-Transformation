# Number One Barbershop Digital Transformation Project

## Overview

This repository documents a three-phase project conducted over three courses at the John Molson School of Business part of the Bachelor of Commerce Degree with Major in Business Technology Management. The project aimed to analyze, design, implement, and recommend IT solutions to improve operational efficiency for **Number One Barbershop** (our client). The focus was on modernizing and optimizing three key subsystems:

1. **Booking & Scheduling** – Streamlining appointment management.
2. **Payment & Commission** – Enhancing financial transactions and commission tracking.
3. **Inventory Management** – Implementing a tracking system and automating stock notifications.

## Course Breakdown

This project evolved through three different courses, each contributing to a specific phase of the **Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC).**

### **BTM 481 – Systems Analysis (Phase 1: Systems Proposal)**

- Conducted a preliminary survey and analyzed existing manual processes.
- Identified system deficiencies and developed functional specifications.
- Performed feasibility and cost-benefit analysis.
- Focused on Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) in depth and covered UML diagrams (use case models, class diagrams, interaction diagrams) at a surface level to document system requirements.

**Final Deliverable:** A **Systems Proposal Report** detailing our findings and analysis.

### **BTM 495 – Systems Design & Implementation (Phase 2: Prototype Development)**

The course introduces the object-oriented approach’s concepts, techniques, and methodologies to information system analysis and design. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is used to develop system design specifications. The main topics include analyzing functional, structural, and behavioural models.

- Transformed system analysis into design specifications. UML was used for high-level system modelling, while functional, structural, and behavioural models were analyzed in depth.
- Developed a functional prototype using:
  - **Backend:** Django (Python-based web framework, ORM for database operations)
  - **Frontend:** React (JavaScript library for user interface development)
  - **Development Database:** SQLite (lightweight embedded database for rapid testing)
  - **Production Recommendation:** PostgreSQL (robust and scalable RDBMS)
- Implemented core functionalities across the three subsystems.

**Final Deliverable:** A **working prototype** demonstrating the system’s capabilities.

### **BTM 496 – IT Strategy, Management & Sourcing (Phase 3: IT Solution Evaluation)**

- Conducted a market analysis and evaluated five SaaS vendors against predefined selection criteria.
- Assessed IT strategy, governance, sourcing, security policies, and change management considerations.
- Recommended an optimal third-party solution for implementation based on business needs.

**Final Deliverable:** A **Vendor Analysis & IT Strategy Report** with the final recommendation.
